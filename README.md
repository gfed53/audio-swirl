Media Swirl: an API hack that retrieves and displays content related to your query.

This app demonstrates AJAX requests (JSONP in this case) to the TASTEKID API. Formerly using solely jQuery and core JS, the app has been refactored as an AngularJS app to display the awesomeness and power of AngularJS as well as AngularUI router to create the same app with great ease.

Being a huge fan of all types of media, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to gain experience working with APIs using this one in particular. Check out the directions section to see what this app is capable of.
