Introducing Audio Swirl, a spinoff to my previously-created Media Swirl focused on just music searching with added features. It involves integration of both the TASTEKiD and Spotify APIs.

Like Media Swirl, this app demonstrates AJAX requests (JSONP in this case) for the TASTEKID API, and also the angular-spotify service to handle the Spotify API functionality. Formerly using solely jQuery and core JS, the app has been refactored as an AngularJS app to display the awesomeness and power of AngularJS as well as AngularUI router to create the same app with great ease.
